### This repo contains my practice on Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
- __HashMap__: This folder contains my implementation of creating HashMap data structure. Here I added basic functions such as _put, contains, remove, keySet, and get_ functions. I used a standard hashcode function of Java for hashing.
- __LinkedList__: This folder contains my implementations of _Singl Linked List, Double Linked List, and Circular Linked Lists_

  
Please read through each folder's README file for further details
